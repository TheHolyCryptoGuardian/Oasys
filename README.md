# What is OasysArchitecture?
Oasys Architecture is built for game developers, offering a high-speed, zero gas fee experience to users by combining the best of public L1 and private L2 blockchain technology solutions.

Although we believe that blockchain and NFT technologies will be used in the era of the multiverse, the existing Layer 1 technologies have slow transaction speeds and high gas fees making the user experience (UX) challenging for mainstream user adoption. Back in 2018, it was very difficult to overcome these challenges. However, by 2021, Layer 2 solutions started becoming available and transactions can be completed at similar speeds as normal servers.

Most of the Layer 2 technology solutions are based on Ethereum as Layer 1, which has high value and therefore high gas cost. Although the transaction speed is instantaneous on L2, it requires a certain amount of gas fees. For this reason, we decided to run Oasys Layer 1 (Consensus Layer), which is an EVM side chain and public blockchain specialized for games, and build it so that users will rarely use Layer 1 directly, and the actual logic of the games will run on the Oasys Layer 2 (Execution Layer). Since each metaverse (game developer) can run its own Layer 2, there are no gas fees for users, and the developer covers these fees. Furthermore, Oasys is an environmentally friendly bockchain that doesn’t cosume energy unnecessarily because of its PoS-based consensus mechanism, so the cost of gas fees for developers will be minimal.

# Oasys will be the Hub of the Multiverse Era!
The NFT craze, Layer 2 technology solutions, the new era of the multiverse, and many other factors have all come together at the right time for the new gaming chain, Oasys. However, these trends alone are not enough to make Oasys a reality; we need the game developers, the gaming community, and most of all, the fans to support us to re-build the future of gaming.

In exciting news, we have a few key members to support Oasys as the Founding Team Members. I’m really thrilled to take the first step toward achieving our dream of becoming a Hub for the Multiverse Era.

Welcome to the Multiverse Era with Oasys!
